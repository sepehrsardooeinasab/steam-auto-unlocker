# Steam Auto Unlocker

Paces out Steam achievement unlocks for a game through [ArchiSteamFarm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm) (ASF), spreading them across realistic delays and sessions instead of firing them all at once.

Runs on macOS and Linux (not Windows).

**[Unlock Scheduler](https://sepehrsardooeinasab.github.io/steam-auto-unlocker/)** — paste a SteamHunters achievement export in the browser and it generates a delay/session config for you.

## How it works

1. Generate a `config_<name>.json` from a SteamHunters achievement export using the [Unlock Scheduler](https://sepehrsardooeinasab.github.io/steam-auto-unlocker/) and drop it in `jsons/` (see [Setup](#setup)).
2. Run `runsteamunlocker <name>` — it makes sure ArchiSteamFarm is running, then walks the achievement list, calling `aset <appid> <achievement>` through ASF's local API with the configured delays between unlocks and idle sessions between groups.
3. Progress is checkpointed to `jsons/progress_<name>.json`, so the script can be stopped and resumed without re-unlocking or losing its place. Once every achievement is unlocked, both files are cleaned up automatically.

## Setup

### 1. ArchiSteamFarm + achievement plugin

`aset` is not a built-in ASF command — it's provided by the [ASFAchievementManager](https://github.com/CatPoweredPlugins/ASFAchievementManager) plugin.

- Download and set up [ArchiSteamFarm](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm).
- Download [ASFAchievementManager](https://github.com/CatPoweredPlugins/ASFAchievementManager) and drop it into ASF's `plugins/` folder.
- Create a bot following ASF's own setup instructions. ASF supports running multiple bots, but this project only assumes a single one (`bot1`) — unlocking achievements on your own account doesn't need more.
- **Required:** create `archifarm/config/IPC.config` so ASF's local API listens on port `1243` — the port `unlocker/api.py` talks to, not ASF's default `1242`. This keeps it off the default port so it can't collide with any other ASF instance you might run (e.g. one used for card farming); the unlocker won't be able to reach ASF at all without it.
  ```json
  {
      "Kestrel": {
          "Endpoints": {
              "HTTP4": { "Url": "http://127.0.0.1:1243" },
              "HTTP6": { "Url": "http://[::1]:1243" }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- For steadier performance, tweak the configs:
  - In the bot's config (`archifarm/config/bot1.json`), set `"FarmingEnabled": false` to stop card farming.
  - In `archifarm/config/ASF.json`, set `"AutoRestart": false` to stop ASF from auto-restarting, and `"Headless": true` so it never blocks on an interactive prompt when `runsteamunlocker` starts it in the background.

### 2. Generate a config from SteamHunters

- On [SteamHunters](https://steamhunters.com), in settings enable **show hidden achievements**, and prefer showing time in seconds.
- Open the page for the game you own and want achievements unlocked for. Find a player with a legitimate, completed profile for it, and use the default sort (normal in-game achievement order, not grouped).
- Select and copy the achievement list text, from the first achievement through the last.
- Paste it into the [Unlock Scheduler](https://sepehrsardooeinasab.github.io/steam-auto-unlocker/), generate the config, and save the resulting file into `jsons/` in this project.

This step is manual because SteamHunters has no public API for per-player achievement data and blocks automated access (Cloudflare-protected, `robots.txt` disallows crawlers) — the Unlock Scheduler exists specifically to make pasted, human-copied text quick to turn into a config.

### 3. Python

Python 3 is required. The unlocker only uses the standard library — no extra packages to install.

### 4. Shell integration

Add the launcher to your `PATH` and (if you use zsh) source the completion script:

```sh
export PATH="/path/to/steam-auto-unlocker:$PATH"
source "/path/to/steam-auto-unlocker/runsteamunlocker.zsh-completion"
```

Put these lines in `~/.zshrc` — or, if you use oh-my-zsh, in a file under `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/` instead, since anything there is auto-sourced. The completion script is zsh-specific; skip the `source` line under bash.

### 5. Notifications (optional)

The unlocker sends a desktop notification when a session finishes, when every achievement is done, and when a run stops unexpectedly: an ASF error, a crash, or the terminal being closed. Stopping it yourself with Ctrl-C or `-k` doesn't send one. Notifications never affect a run. If no notification tool is available, they're skipped.

- **macOS, full version:** `brew install terminal-notifier`. Notifications show the game name as a subtitle and the project logo. Errors use a different sound ("Basso" instead of "Glass"). "Done" notifications remove themselves after 30 minutes, while errors stay until you dismiss them.
- **macOS, basic (no install):** if `terminal-notifier` isn't installed, a plain notification is shown through `osascript`, with no logo and no auto-removal. If nothing appears, allow notifications for **Script Editor** in System Settings → Notifications.
- **Linux:** needs `notify-send`. Install `libnotify-bin` on Debian/Ubuntu, or `libnotify` on Fedora/Arch. Errors are marked critical. "Done" notifications ask to expire after 30 minutes, though some desktops (e.g. GNOME) ignore that. Sounds depend on your desktop.

### 6. Keeping the system awake

While a session runs (including any `-w` / `-in` wait before it), the unlocker keeps the computer from sleeping so delays aren't stretched by a suspended machine.

- **macOS:** uses the built-in `caffeinate`. Nothing to install.
- **Linux:** uses `systemd-inhibit` (part of systemd) to hold a sleep/idle inhibitor. If it's missing or can't take the inhibitor (e.g. no logind session), the run goes ahead without it. Closing a laptop lid may still suspend it, depending on your desktop's lid settings.

## Layout

- `unlocker/` — the Python package that drives unlocking:
  - `runner.py` — the unlock loop: delays, session breaks, resuming from saved progress
  - `api.py` — talks to ArchiSteamFarm's local Web API (`aset`, `play`, `reset`)
  - `state.py` — reads/writes `jsons/config_*.json` and `jsons/progress_*.json`
  - `run_unlocker.py` — CLI entry point
- `runsteamunlocker` — bash launcher: starts ArchiSteamFarm if needed, then runs the unlocker for a given config
- `runsteamunlocker.zsh-completion` — tab-completion for available configs
- `docs/` — the Unlock Scheduler web page (published via GitHub Pages)
- `jsons/`, `csvs/`, `archifarm/` — per-machine runtime data (ASF install, bot credentials, generated configs); gitignored, not part of the repo
- `completed/` — finished games: each game's config and CSV are moved to `completed/<name>/` once every achievement is unlocked (gitignored)

## Usage

```sh
runsteamunlocker <config-name>      # run the unlocker using jsons/config_<config-name>.json
runsteamunlocker -f <config-name>   # same, but skip the confirmation prompt
runsteamunlocker -w <config-name>   # confirm now, wait until the session can run, then start it
runsteamunlocker -in 2h <config-name>  # confirm now, start in 2h (also 30, 45m, 1h30m)
runsteamunlocker -t <config-name>   # print the next session's wait/duration and exit, without running
runsteamunlocker -s <config-name>   # show achievements from the current session onward (names, done/next)
runsteamunlocker -s <config-name> all  # every session; or a number for just that session
runsteamunlocker -k                 # stop ArchiSteamFarm and any running unlocker session
runsteamunlocker -a / --all         # list available jsons/config_*.json profiles
runsteamunlocker -j / --json        # open the Unlock Scheduler (docs/index.html) in the browser
runsteamunlocker -c / --code        # open the project in VS Code
runsteamunlocker -h                 # help
```

## Disclaimer

This doesn't violate Steam's own terms of service, but it does violate the rules of achievement-tracking/ranking sites (e.g. SteamHunters) that expect achievements to reflect legitimate play. Use at your own risk.
